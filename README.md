# frontend-playground
A personal playground for practicing front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repo will contain multiple projects, experiments, and mini-apps to improve my front-end skills. From UI components and animations to full web applications, this space will be used for continuous learning and creative exploration. ðŸš€
